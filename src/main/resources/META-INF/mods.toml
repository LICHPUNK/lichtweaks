LichTweaks is a Minecraft mod created by myself, A.K.A. LICH or LICHPUNK, out of passion for the game, pixel art, game development, and programming in general. It's currently being sought out as an opportunity to hone my skills in the aspects mentioned, and to contribute to a community I've enjoyed taking part in for over a decade now; it will continually be developed over time with the goal of eventually reaching an official full release.

The current vision for the mod intends to add custom content and assets with a considerable focus on fantasy elements. More specifically, based on the undead creature(s), known as Lich, and their lore; whose inspiration is also reflected in my alias. Ideas are vast for this project but the additions will generally be along the lines of staves, scrolls, spells, undead, necromancy, treasure, botany, brewing, etc. All elements are intended to be balanced and only enhance the experience of the game without making the player, ironically enough, actually immortal. Everything will be designed with the intention to mimic the general feel of Minecraft as an experience; seeking to act as an extension of what the vanilla game already has to offer.
